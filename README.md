Categorizer

Categorizer v1.0 is a tool to classify genes into user-defined groups (categories) based on GeneOntology (GO) annotations and their semantic similarities. Most GO-based analysis tools are designed to identify enrichments of individual GO terms in a set of genes, and they frequently output lists of redundant or highly specific GO terms that can be difficult to interpret. Categorizer assigns genes to user-defined categories and calculates p-values for the enrichment of each category. This new tool takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of GO annotations and the semantic similarity between GO terms for a reliable categorization. Categorizer will help experimental and computational biologists analyzing genomic and proteomic data according to their specific interests.
